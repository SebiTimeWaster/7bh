These are my solutions to the programming-themed game "7 Billion Humans".                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
You can import them into the game by selecting the code and then clicking the "Paste" button on the game's editor. It wasn't always possible to achieve both size and speed optimizations in the same program so some are split up into separate programs.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The solutions cover all size and speed optimizations ("OCD"s) for all levels.

The result is functionally equivalent while doesn't look very intuitive. |                                                                                                                                                            
|66 - Decimal Counter (speed)                   |79/23          |**118/120**    |  This solution was to not make a general purpose counter, but something for the specific circumstances of the problem. It's completely silly and single-threaded.|

And similarly to that one, there are some dummy calc instructions to make sure sensor workers run exactly in parallel. |

|67 - Decimal Doubler (alternate)               |158/25         |331/250        |  This solution didn't make the size or speed targets but I think the approach is cool so I'm keeping it. The idea here was to have **all** workers compute a running accumulator of the current power of two, and then use a poor man's bit shift to isolate the digit for their place value (e.g., ones, tens, hundreds). It's set up so all of these happen exactly in parallel with no synchronization between workers. It's worth pointing out that while you can only load a mem with literal values up to 99, mems can store values way higher than that- high enough so that there isn't some numerical limit holding back this approach. Anyway the calc instructions are, incidentally, what kills the speed. I still think the concept is cool. Since the button-operator is set up to idle around for exactly-the-right-amount-of-time, there is not much synchronization between workers at all.|

First, finding the most compact way to avoid hazardous holes, but permit the target hole. To do this I tried to exploit that multiple clauses if-ed together still count as one instruction. Second, the last one out needs to use the "tell" instruction. For this, I used a heuristic in the form of a many-clause if statement. The heuristic is just a heuristic, and won't be valid in 100% of cases. It makes the target so for now it's good enough. One thing that was good was to scope the "am I the last one out?" check down to happen in only a narrow set of circumstances.|                                                                                                                                                          
|68 - Goodbye Humans (speed)                    |24/9           |**49/50**      |  The bottleneck here is it's hard to make a general path where workers won't constantly run into each other. I used the size-optimization solution as a starting point, and started special-casing more things, fussing with it until it came under time. Very much an ugly and not a scientific process. |
