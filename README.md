These are my solutions to the programming-themed game "7 Billion Humans".                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
You can import them into the game by selecting the code and then clicking the "Paste" button on the game's editor. It wasn't always possible to achieve both size and speed optimizations in the same program so some are split up into separate programs.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The solutions cover all size and speed optimizations ("OCD"s) for all levels.
